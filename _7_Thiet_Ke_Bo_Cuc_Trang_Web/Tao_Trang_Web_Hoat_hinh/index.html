                       Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん Japanese pronunciation: [do̞ɾa̠e̞mõ̞ɴ]) is a Japanese <br/>manga series written and illustrated by Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of the duo <br/> Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. The series has also been adapted into a successful anime series and media franchise. <br/>The story revolves around an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a boy named Nobita Nobi (野比のび太, Nobi Nobita).

                       The first full story in the Doraemon manga series was published in January 1970.<br/> A pre-advertisement for the manga was published in six different magazines in December 1969. A total of 1,465 stories were created in the original series, which are published by Shogakukan. <br/>It is one of the best-selling manga in the world, and has sold over 100 million copies as of 2015.

                       The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in Toyama, Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. Turner Broadcasting System bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for an English-language release in the United States,[3] but cancelled it without explanation <br/>before broadcasting any episodes. In July 2013, Voyager Japan announced the manga would be released digitally in English via the Amazon Kindle e-book service.
